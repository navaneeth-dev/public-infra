Self hosted foss services hosted by me.

## Services

| Name | Url |

| Grafana | https://grafana.fossindia.ovh |

## Goals

- Replace closed source apps with FOSS (Google, Vaultwarden, etc...)
- Full control over data
- Decenteralize infrastructure

## Why?

To support foss and to learn IaC (terraform, ansible etc...). Plus some FOSS
apps are much better than closed source ones.

## TODO

- vaultwarden
- matrix server
- migrate to k8s
