# FOSS Infrastructure

Self hosted foss services hosted by me.

## Services

| Name | Url |
| --- | ---- |
| CommaFeed | https://commafeed.foss.rizexor.com |
| PairDrop | https://pairdrop.foss.rizexor.com |
| Grafana | https://grafana.foss.rizexor.com |
| Uptime Kuma | https://status.foss.rizexor.com |
| Ntfy | https://ntfy.foss.rizexor.com |

## Goals

- Replace closed source apps with FOSS (Google, Vaultwarden, etc...)
- Full control over data
- Decenteralize infrastructure

## Why?

To support foss and to learn IaC (terraform, ansible etc...). Plus some FOSS
apps are much better than closed source ones.

## TODO

- ntfy.sh
- vaultwarden
- matrix server
- migrate to k8s
